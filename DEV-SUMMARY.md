## Session Summary: v5.7.0 Release

### Overview

This development period covered server configuration improvements and a player auth bug fix:
1. **v5.7.0** - Admin-configurable Server URL for QR codes (no container rebuild needed)
2. **v5.7.0** - Player auth verify-player 401 redirect fix

---

## v5.7.0 - Admin-Configurable Server URL

**Release Date:** 2026-02-19
**Branch:** `server-url-tweaks-v5.7.0`

### Features

#### Admin Server URL Setting
- New "Server Settings" panel in Admin > Settings tab
- Displays auto-detected server IP and active QR code URL
- Custom Server URL input field with save/clear buttons
- URL priority chain: DB setting > SERVER_URL env var > HOST_IP env var > auto-detected IP
- Changes take effect immediately for new QR codes without container restart
- URL validation ensures valid format before saving

#### Dynamic QR Code URL Resolution
- Replaced static `SERVER_URL` constant with dynamic `getServerUrl()` function
- QR code URLs now resolved per-request instead of at server startup
- `loadQuizOptions()` expanded to load `server_url` from `app_settings` table
- GET/POST `/api/options` endpoints updated to include `serverUrl`, `detectedIp`, and `activeServerUrl`

### Bug Fixes

#### Player Auth Redirect Fix
- **Problem:** Registered players with expired tokens were redirected to landing page instead of the player join screen when scanning QR codes
- **Root Cause:** The `useApi` 401 interceptor didn't exclude `verify-player` requests, so expired player tokens triggered `authStore.logout()` + redirect to `/`
- **Fix:** Added `verify-player` to the player auth request exclusion list in `useApi.js`, allowing the PlayerPage's catch block to handle the 401 gracefully (clears stale token, shows join screen)

### Database Migration

**New migration:** `15-server-url-setting.sql`
```sql
INSERT INTO app_settings (setting_key, setting_value, description)
VALUES ('server_url', '', 'Server URL for QR codes (leave empty to auto-detect from IP)')
ON CONFLICT (setting_key) DO NOTHING;
```

### Files Created
- `app/init/15-server-url-setting.sql` - Database migration for server_url setting
- `app/src/components/admin/ServerSettingsPanel.vue` - Server Settings panel component

### Files Modified
- `app/server.js` - `getServerUrl()` function, dynamic URL resolution, updated loadQuizOptions/GET/POST options endpoints, QR endpoints
- `app/src/composables/useApi.js` - Added verify-player to 401 exclusion list
- `app/src/pages/AdminPage.vue` - Import and add ServerSettingsPanel to Settings tab
- `app/src/config/version.js` - Bumped to v5.7.0

## v5.6.0 - Game Experience & Results Display

**Release Date:** 2026-02-18
**Branch:** `feature-enhancements-v5.6.0`

### Features

#### Question Progress Counter
- "X / Y" pill badge showing revealed questions vs total in Player navbar, Display sidebar, and Presenter controls
- Server broadcasts `revealedCount` and `totalQuestions` with `questionRevealed` and `playerListUpdate` events
- Late joiners and reconnecting players receive current count immediately

#### End-of-Game Results Podium
- Celebratory podium-style results screen with gold/silver/bronze for top 3 players
- Staggered entrance animations for each podium slot
- Remaining players listed below with rank and score
- Class average chip in header
- Per-quiz `show_results` toggle (defaults to TRUE, opt-out model)
- Admin toggle in Quiz Sidebar dropdown menu with "Results" badge on quiz items

#### Quiz Completion Screen
- Universal "Quiz Complete!" screen shown for ALL quizzes when they finish
- For results-enabled quizzes: animated countdown "Results in 5...4...3..." before podium appears
- For non-results quizzes: static message "Check your Progress to see how you did!"
- Both Player and Display pages show the completion screen
- Smooth transition from completion screen to results podium

#### Manual Mode Auto-Complete
- When all questions are revealed in manual mode (no auto-pilot), quiz automatically completes
- Waits for the answer display timeout so players can see the last answer
- Then triggers the same completion flow as auto-pilot (save, broadcast, results)

#### Multiple Simultaneous Displays
- Each Display/Spectator connection gets a unique ID (e.g., `Display-a3f9`)
- `isSpectator: true` flag sent in join payload as authoritative source for spectator detection
- Reserved name protection: players cannot name themselves "Display" or "Spectator"
- Reconnection lookup skips spectator entries to prevent socket hijacking

#### Bug Fixes
- **Shuffle All Choices**: Now skips True/False questions (prevents answer corruption)
- **Heartbeat False Positives**: Raised high-latency log threshold from 1000ms to 2000ms (browser tab throttling causes ~1000ms readings on desktop)
- **Stale Room Rejoin**: Clear `localStorage.trivia_last_room` on `roomClosed` and `roomError` events
- **Auto-Pilot State Reset**: Reset `autoMode`, `timerStartedAt`, `timerDuration`, `timerPaused` when leaving/closing rooms on Player, Display, and Presenter pages

### Database Migration

**New migration:** `14-show-results-setting.sql`
```sql
ALTER TABLE quizzes ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS show_results BOOLEAN DEFAULT TRUE;
```

### Files Created
- `app/init/14-show-results-setting.sql` - Database migration for show_results column

## Previous Session Summary: v5.5.0 Release

### Overview

This development period covered backend performance optimizations:
1. **v5.5.0** - Backend performance optimizations (memory cleanup, rate limiting, session health monitoring)
2. **v5.5.0** - Session Health admin panel with memory and session statistics
3. **v5.5.0** - Configurable Socket.IO rate limits via environment variables
4. **v5.5.0** - Presenter layout reorganization (two-column controls)

---

## v5.5.0 - Backend Performance & Session Health

**Release Date:** 2026-02-08
**Branch:** `main`

### Features

#### Backend Performance Optimizations
- **Memory Cleanup Scheduler**: Added `cleanupSocketRateLimits()` to the periodic cleanup interval that runs every 5 minutes. Cleans up stale entries from `socketRateLimits` and `socketJoinTracker` Maps.
- **Socket.IO Rate Limiting**: Per-IP rate limiting for `joinRoom` (50/minute) and `submitAnswer` (300/minute) events to prevent abuse
- **Room Activity Tracking**: Added `lastActivityAt` field to rooms, updated on join, presentQuestion, and submitAnswer events. Room expiry now uses actual activity time (4-hour inactivity timeout).

#### Session Health Monitoring
- **Admin Memory Endpoint**: New `/api/admin/memory` endpoint returning:
  - Memory usage (heap, RSS, external, arrayBuffers)
  - Session counts (active rooms, total players, rate limit entries)
  - Server uptime
  - Live room details (room code, players, questions, last activity)
- **Session Health Panel**: New admin tab with visual dashboard featuring:
  - Memory usage progress bars with color-coding (green <60%, yellow 60-80%, red >80%)
  - Session counts grid with room, player, and rate limit counts
  - Server uptime display
  - Live rooms table with detailed statistics
  - Auto-refresh toggle (10-second interval)

#### Configurable Socket.IO Rate Limits
Environment variables for tuning rate limits for venues with many players on shared IP (NAT):
- `SOCKET_RATE_WINDOW_MS` - Rate limit window (default: 60000ms / 1 minute)
- `SOCKET_JOIN_LIMIT` - Max join attempts per IP per window (default: 50)
- `SOCKET_ANSWER_LIMIT` - Max answer submissions per IP per window (default: 300)

#### Presenter Layout Improvements
- Reorganized presenter controls into two-column layout
- Left column: Progress indicator, Previous/Next buttons, Present Question, Reveal Answer, Complete Quiz
- Right column: Auto-Pilot toggle with timer settings, Auto-Reveal toggle
- Responsive design: single column on mobile (<900px width)

### Files Created
- `app/src/components/admin/SessionHealthPanel.vue` - Session Health dashboard component

### Files Modified
- `app/server.js` - Rate limiting, memory cleanup, activity tracking, admin memory endpoint
- `app/src/config/constants.js` - Added SOCKET_RATE_WINDOW_MS, SOCKET_JOIN_LIMIT, SOCKET_ANSWER_LIMIT defaults
- `app/src/config/environment.js` - Added socketRateWindowMs, socketJoinLimit, socketAnswerLimit config
- `app/src/pages/AdminPage.vue` - Session Health tab integration

## Previous Session Summary: v5.4.0 - v5.4.4 Release

### Overview

This development period covered the Auto-Mode & Solo Play features:
1. **v5.4.0** - Auto-Mode Timer System for presenters (server-side timers with pause/resume)
2. **v5.4.0** - Solo Play Mode for players (REST-based self-study without presenter)
3. **v5.4.1** - Database migration fix for guest participants
4. **v5.4.2** - Session service ON CONFLICT fix for guests
5. **v5.4.3** - Timer pause/resume sync fix for player clients
6. **v5.4.4** - Solo mode UI fixes (answer text theming, selection reset)

---

## v5.4.4 - Solo Mode UI Fixes

**Release Date:** 2026-02-06
**Branch:** `main`

### Fixes

1. **Answer Text Theme Colors**: Added `color: var(--text-primary)` to `.choice-btn` and `.choice-text` in SoloPlayPage.vue. Button elements don't inherit text color, causing black text in dark mode.

2. **Answer Selection Reset**: Created `goToNextQuestion()` wrapper function that resets `selectedAnswer` to null before calling `advanceToNextQuestion()`. Previously, the selected styling persisted to the next question.

### Files Modified
- `app/src/pages/SoloPlayPage.vue` - Theme colors and selection reset

---

## v5.4.3 - Timer Pause/Resume Sync Fix

**Release Date:** 2026-02-06
**Branch:** `main`

### Problem Solved

When presenter paused auto-mode, the server updated correctly but player timer bars continued running. On resume, players saw incorrect timer state.

### Root Cause

The CountdownTimer component's `updateBar()` and `updateText()` functions only checked `props.active` but not `props.paused`. The watcher on `[startedAt, duration]` also didn't check paused state before restarting.

### Fix

Added `props.paused` checks to:
- `updateBar()` - Returns early if paused
- `updateText()` - Returns early if paused
- Watcher on `[startedAt, duration]` - Only restarts if not paused

### Files Modified
- `app/src/components/player/CountdownTimer.vue`

---

## v5.4.2 - Session Service ON CONFLICT Fix

**Release Date:** 2026-02-06
**Branch:** `main`

### Problem Solved

Session auto-save failed with error: `there is no unique or exclusion constraint matching the ON CONFLICT specification`

### Root Cause

Migration 13 dropped the full unique constraint on `(user_id, game_session_id)` and replaced it with a partial unique index (only for non-NULL user_ids). The old `ON CONFLICT` clause couldn't find a matching constraint for guest users.

### Fix

Modified `saveSession()` in session.service.js:
- For registered users (with user_id): Use `ON CONFLICT (user_id, game_session_id) WHERE user_id IS NOT NULL`
- For guest users (NULL user_id): Use SELECT + INSERT/UPDATE pattern since NULLs don't conflict

### Files Modified
- `app/src/services/session.service.js`

---

## v5.4.1 - Guest Participants Migration Fix

**Release Date:** 2026-02-06
**Branch:** `main`

### Problem Solved

Solo play failed with: `null value in column "user_id" of relation "game_participants" violates not-null constraint`

### Root Cause

Migration 12 was already applied before the guest participant changes were added. The automatic migration system correctly tracks applied migrations, so modifying an already-applied migration doesn't re-run it.

### Fix

Created new migration file `13-fix-solo-guest-participants.sql` with the same changes:
- `ALTER COLUMN user_id DROP NOT NULL`
- Drop existing unique constraint
- Create partial unique index for authenticated users only

Also fixed `presentation_order` NOT NULL constraint in solo.controller.js INSERT statement.

### Files Created
- `app/init/13-fix-solo-guest-participants.sql`

### Files Modified
- `app/src/controllers/solo.controller.js` - Added presentation_order to INSERT
- `app/src/composables/useSoloGame.js` - Fixed API response extraction (response.data.data)

## Previous Session Summary: v5.0.0 - v5.1.2 Release

### Overview

This development period covered multiple releases:
1. **v5.0.0** - Multi-Admin Support with session isolation, account settings, and UI/UX improvements
2. **v5.1.0** - Automatic database migration system with version-based tracking
3. **v5.1.1** - Idempotent migrations fix for existing databases
4. **v5.1.2** - Login modal fix for registered account authentication

---

## v5.1.2 - Login Modal Fix

**Release Date:** 2026-01-28
**Branch:** `main`

### Problem Solved

When a player tried to join a room using a registered account username from a new device (where they hadn't logged in), the app threw a JavaScript error instead of showing the login modal.

**Error:** `loginPassword is not defined`

### Root Cause

During the Phase 4 refactoring (commit `2a2ad5b`), modal components were extracted from PlayerPage. The `loginPassword` ref was correctly removed from the declarations, but one usage at line 1197 was missed:

```javascript
// This line was left behind after refactoring
loginPassword.value = ''  // ❌ ReferenceError
```

The `LoginModal.vue` component now manages its own password field internally, so this line was no longer needed.

### Fix

Removed the orphaned `loginPassword.value = ''` line from `handleJoinRoom()` function.

**File Modified:** `app/src/pages/PlayerPage.vue`

---

## v5.1.1 - Idempotent Migrations Fix

**Release Date:** 2026-01-27

### Fix

Made all database migrations idempotent (safe to run on existing databases) by adding proper `IF NOT EXISTS` and `IF EXISTS` clauses.

---

## v5.1.0 - Auto Database Migrations

**Release Date:** 2026-01-26
**Branch:** `database-schema-fix-v5`

### Problem Solved

When deploying new Docker images to production, database schema changes were not automatically applied. The previous `db-init.js` had two critical issues:
1. **Hardcoded migration list** - Only included migrations 01-05, missing 06 and 07
2. **All-or-nothing check** - If `users` table existed, ALL migrations were skipped

### Implementation

**File Modified:** `app/db-init.js` - Complete rewrite

**New Migration System:**
1. **Version-based tracking** - Stores app version in `schema_migrations` table
2. **Version comparison** - Compares stored version with `version.js` VERSION
3. **Conditional execution** - Only runs migration check when versions differ
4. **Dynamic file scanning** - Automatically detects all `*.sql` files in `init/` directory
5. **Individual tracking** - Records each migration file to prevent re-running
6. **Idempotent design** - All migrations use `IF NOT EXISTS` clauses

**Startup Behavior:**
- **Same version**: Skip migrations, fast startup (just 2 queries)
- **Version change**: Check for pending migrations, apply them, update stored version
- **Fresh install**: Run all migrations, store version

### Key Code Patterns

```javascript
// Version tracking in schema_migrations table
// Uses special row: '__app_version_5.1.0__'

async function getStoredVersion(pool) {
  const result = await pool.query(
    "SELECT filename FROM schema_migrations WHERE filename LIKE '__app_version_%'"
  );
  // Extract version from pattern
}

async function updateStoredVersion(pool, version) {
  await pool.query("DELETE FROM schema_migrations WHERE filename LIKE '__app_version_%'");
  await pool.query('INSERT INTO schema_migrations (filename) VALUES ($1)',
    [`__app_version_${version}__`]);
}
```

---

## v5.0.0 - Multi-Admin Support & UI Improvements

**Release Date:** 2026-01-26
**Branch:** `app-enhancements-v5.0.0`

### 1. Multi-Admin Session Isolation

**Purpose:** Allow multiple admins to operate independently with their own quizzes and sessions.

**Implementation:**

- **Auth Middleware** (`app/src/middleware/auth.js`)
  - Added `is_root_admin` flag fetching in `requireAdmin` middleware
  - Flag is attached to `req.user` for downstream filtering

- **Session Controller** (`app/src/controllers/session.controller.js`)
  - Modified `listSessionsFromDB()` to accept filtering options
  - Regular admins see only sessions where `created_by = user_id`
  - Root admin sees all sessions (no filtering)
  - Added `created_by_username` to session responses

- **Socket.IO Ownership Validation** (`app/server.js`)
  - `resumeSession`: Validates admin owns the session before resuming
  - `viewRoom`: Validates admin owns the room before viewing
  - `closeRoom`: Validates admin owns the room before closing

- **Presenter Page** (`app/src/pages/PresenterPage.vue`)
  - Passes `userId` and `isRootAdmin` to socket events
  - Filters active rooms based on ownership

### 2. Session Creator Display

**Purpose:** Root admin can see which admin created each session.

**Implementation:**

- **Sessions List Component** (`app/src/components/admin/SessionsList.vue`)
  - Added `isRootAdmin` prop
  - Displays "by {username}" badge when viewing as root admin
  - Styled with info color theme

### 3. Last Seen Bug Fix

**Problem:** Admin "last seen" showed "Never logged in" even after logging in.

**Root Cause:** Query only tracked game participation via `game_sessions`, not session token activity.

**Fix:** (`app/src/controllers/user.controller.js`)
```sql
GREATEST(
  MAX(gs.created_at),
  MAX(us.last_used_at)
) as last_seen
```
Now combines game session timestamps with user session token activity.

### 4. User Management Visual Alignment

**Problem:** Email and login status columns didn't align across different user sections.

**Fix:** (`app/src/components/admin/UserCategorySection.vue`)
- Changed from flexbox to CSS Grid layout
- Defined column proportions: `minmax(180px, 1fr) minmax(200px, 1.5fr) auto`
- Added text truncation with ellipsis for long content
- Mobile responsive with single-column stacking

### 5. Presenter Navbar Dropdown

**Purpose:** Match Admin page navbar style with dropdown menu.

**Changes:** (`app/src/components/presenter/PresenterNavbar.vue`)
- Replaced inline username/logout with dropdown button
- Added Account Settings and Logout options
- Added click-outside-to-close behavior
- Styled to match AdminNavbar

### 6. Presenter Account Settings Modal

**Purpose:** Allow admins to manage account settings from Presenter page.

**Changes:** (`app/src/pages/PresenterPage.vue`)
- Added Account Settings modal (matching AdminPage)
- Email address management
- Password change with verification
- Password visibility toggles

### 7. Player Disconnect Fix

**Problem:** Players clicking "Leave Room" weren't marked as disconnected immediately.

**Root Cause:** Disconnect handler set `connected = false` but not `connectionState`.

**Fix:** (`app/server.js:2093`)
```javascript
room.players[socket.id].connected = false;
room.players[socket.id].connectionState = 'disconnected';
```

### 8. Case Sensitivity Fix

**Problem:** Docker builds failed due to file name case mismatch.

**Fix:** Renamed `AdminNavBar.vue` to `AdminNavbar.vue` to match import statements (Linux is case-sensitive).

## Database Changes

### New Table: schema_migrations
```sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS schema_migrations (
  filename VARCHAR(100) PRIMARY KEY,
  applied_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);
```

### Existing Migrations (already present)
- Migration 06: `add-media-fields.sql` - Question image support
- Migration 07: `multi-admin-support.sql` - is_root_admin, created_by columns

## Patterns Learned

### 1. Version-Based Migration Tracking
Store app version in a special table row to enable fast startup when version unchanged.

### 2. Case Sensitivity in Docker
Always use consistent case for file names - Linux/Docker is case-sensitive while Windows is not.

### 3. Connection State Management
When disconnecting players, set BOTH `connected` and `connectionState` for immediate UI feedback.

### 4. CSS Grid for Alignment
Use CSS Grid instead of flexbox when column alignment across multiple rows is required.

## Testing Notes

### Database Migration System
- [x] Fresh install runs all 7 migrations
- [x] Same version restart skips migrations (fast startup)
- [x] Version change triggers migration check
- [x] Idempotent migrations safe to run multiple times

### Multi-Admin Session Isolation
- [x] Regular admin can only see their own sessions
- [x] Root admin can see all sessions
- [x] Session creator badge visible to root admin only
- [x] Cannot resume/view/close sessions owned by other admins

### Account Settings
- [x] Can change email from Admin page
- [x] Can change email from Presenter page
- [x] Password change requires current password
- [x] Password visibility toggle works

### Player Disconnect
- [x] Player clicking "Leave Room" shows as disconnected immediately
- [x] Network disconnect also marks player as disconnected
